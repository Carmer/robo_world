#RoboWorld

This was an exercise in Sinatra during the first week of the second module at TuringSchool.
The goal was to create a Sinatra App from scratch and implement CRUD functionality. This app should be a directory of robots. A robot has a name, city, state, avatar, birthdate, date hired, and department. The CRUD functionality for this app should allow the user to see all robots, see one specific robot, edit/update a robot, create a robot, and delete a robot
